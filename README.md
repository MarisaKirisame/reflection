Reflection
==========
This is a C++ reflection library which strive to provide the following feature:
Compile time Inspection of existence/return type of type/variable/function
Dynamical modification of second class citizen member function/ member 
Runtime Inspection of existence/return type of type/variable/function ( including second class citizen as well )
Runtime calling of function/ extraction of variable ( also including second class citizen )
while maintaining a minimal extra code ( only one line for the *entire program ) and no external tool dependency ( this is written with MetaProgramming ) directly
